# Pandas Challenge
DA Bootcamp

### Summary

In this project, two cvs files were utilized create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
- Final code can be located in PyCitySchools/main.ipynm
- Two CVS files can be located in Resource folder


### Analysis
Utilizing this analysis, we can provide insite to the school district to assit them in making budgeting and future project decisions. 
- With the 'Scores by School Spending' analysis we can see that the higher the budget per student the school has, the lower the average scores and passing rates for both math and reading are. Across all areas measured the student assessments decrease at each step of the budget categories. 
- Another trend that is seen in the DataFrame analysis is that reading scores are higher than math scores, for both average scores and percent of students passing in that area. This trend is consistent across all areas including grade levels, specific schools, school type, school size, and school budgets. It would be recommended to the district that increased resources be allocated to and focused on the students math comprehension.
- Further analysis may be necessary to determine the coorelation between the size, budget per student, and type as it relates to average and passing scores. For example, does the budget per student of all small schools affect the scores?
